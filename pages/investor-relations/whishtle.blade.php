        <h3>THE PURPOSE OF THIS POLICY</h3>

        <p>Halder Venture Limited is committed to complying with the laws that apply to them, the Code of Conduct of
          the Company and particularly to assuring that business is conducted with integrity and that the Company’s
          financial information is accurate which is relied upon by its shareholders, the financial markets and
          other stakeholders. It protects employees, customers and/or third-party intermediaries wishing to raise a
          concern about serious irregularities within the Company. If potential violations of Company policies or
          applicable laws are not recognized and addressed promptly, both the Company and those working for or with
          the Company could face governmental investigation, prosecution, fines, and other penalties. To promote
          ethical standards, the Company will maintain a workplace that facilitates reporting of potential
          violations of Company policies and applicable laws. Employees and Directors may raise concerns regarding
          such potential violations easily and free of any fear of retaliation. That is the purpose of this policy
          (the “Policy” or the “Whistleblower Policy”).</p>
